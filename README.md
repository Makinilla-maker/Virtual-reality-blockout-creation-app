# BlockoutVR - Virtual Reality Blockout Creation Tool

## Description

Welcome to the BlockoutVR repository, an innovative blockout creation app designed for virtual reality. This project aims to provide designers, artists, and developers an intuitive and immersive tool for efficiently prototyping and designing 3D scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Reality Environment:** BlockoutVR harnesses the power of virtual reality to offer an immersive design experience. Interact directly with your scenes as you create them.

- **Intuitive Block Creation:** Quickly design structures and environments using predefined blocks in a 3D space. 

- **Aspect Customization:** Apply materials to your blocks for a more realistic representation of your scenarios.

- **Intuitive Navigation:** Move through your creation with ease using virtual reality controllers. Change your viewpoint and scale to get a full picture of your scene.

- **Export and Compatibility:** Export your designs in popular formats for further use in game engines and 3D modeling tools. 

## Controls
- With the left joystick you can move around the world. In case you get dizzy, you can use the menus to change the type of movement to teleportation.

- To move with tp, just point the joystick to the place where you want the camera to go and press the grab button.
